    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
      <p>There are endless amounts of cloud storages out in the current market. Having too many options makes it difficult to keep things organized and simplified. Bridge is here to help consolidate all cloud storages in one place to keep things synchronized, simplified, organized and shareable.</p>

    <h1>Discovery</h1>
      <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
        <div>
        <h3>95.2%</h3>
          <p>use cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, etc., showing the <span class="bolded-text">prevalence and importance</span></p>
        <h3>85%</h3>
          <p>use it for <span class="bolded-text">personal</span> use while 60% used it for <span class="bolded-text">work</span></p>
        <h3>75%</h3>
          <p>of the participants use <span class="bolded-text">Google Drive the most,</span> followed by iCloud and Dropbox</p>
        <h3>80%</h3>
          <p>responded that <span class="bolded-text">sharing content and storing file</span> was the most important</p>
        <h3>50%</h3>
          <p>of the respondents said that they were <span class="bolded-text">creating new content</span> (notes, documents, etc.)</p>
        <h3>19%</h3>
          <p>said it was <span class="bolded-text">easy to use</span></p>
          <p>*Percentage based on 21 respondents</p>
        </div>
      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>In order to determine the direction for Bridge, I needed to deep dive into the market and perform a competitive analysis and SWOT analysis on the competitors. In the survey, I asked the participants which storages they used the most. Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox were the top three. But since I wanted to create a more creative cloud storage product for the creatives, I conducted a competitive analysis on Google Drive, Pinterest and Dropbox.</p>

        <button class="secondary-button" type="button">Competitive analysis<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right about-me-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
      <h2>FINDINGS</h2>
        <p>From the analysis, we determined that a new cloud storage and organizer with the following traits would be a great competitor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Accessible anytime and anywhere with real-time updates on multiple devices</li>
          <li>2. Strong cloud security features (ex: various sharing modes)</li>
          <li>3. Stores all types of files: images, videos, creative docs, etc.</li>
          <li>4. Intuitive and clear functionality</li>
          <li>5. Fast sync/upload</li>
          <li>6. Own creation apps</li>
          <li>7. Accurate visual search</li>
          <li>8. Flexible cost and plan</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>USER STORIES</h2>
        <p>From the information gathered from market research and competitive analysis, I created a user story to prioritize the main features of the product. Then I created the user flows in Whimsical to illustrate how a user will go through the app to accomplish those goals.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>I want to create my account.</li>

    <h1>Branding & Identity</h1>
    <p>Bridge was chosen as the name of the storage because it accurately depicts what the product does. Not only does the product act as a Bridge <span class="bolded-text">connecting the various cloud storages</span> in one place, but it also <span class="bolded-text">bridges the gaps and spaces</span> and <span class="bolded-text">connects users</span> by allowing the files to be accessed and shared from anywhere.</p>

      <p><span class="bolded-text">Museo Sans</span> – a sans-serif typeface – is the perfect partner, as it’s simplicity helps to counteract some of Playfair Displays flair.

      <p><span class="bolded-text">Playfair Display</span> adds a playful but elegant touch that goes well with the overall theme and look of the product.</p>

    <h1>Development</h1>
    <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
    <p>Once I was done creating my wireframes, I performed the Usability Testing to get some feedback. Participants had confusion around the CTA button labeled as Bridge Now on the Landing Page, so I updated that to Get Started.</p>
      <h3>Participant 1</h3>
      <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>Confusion: Two options to sign up on Landing Page (Sign Up and Get Started)</p>
      <h3>Participant 2</h3>
      <h4>Marketing Manager</h4>
      <p>Confusion: Organizing a file vs Sharing<br>Benefit: Clear icons</p>
      <h3>Participant 3</h3>
      <h4>Media Planner</h4>
      <p>Confusion: Organizing a file vs Sharing </p>

    <h2>A & B TESTING</h2>
    <p>Test 1 - Which cancel button do you prefer?</p>
    <p>I had 13 participants who participated in the test. 100% of the group preferred the blue CTA button. Some of the reasons listed were: easy to tell, consistent with iOS guidelines, stands out more, etc. This helped me to be confident in my decision to keep the CTA button blue.</p>
    <h3>| A</h3>
    <img>normal cancel</img>
    <h3>| B</h3>
    <img>iOS cancel</img>

    <p>Test 2 - Do you prefer to have the 'Bridge Helps You...' section on the screen or not?</p>
    <p>I had 12 participants in the test. 58% preferred taking out the section over the 42% who preferred to leave it. My biggest worry is being redundant, but the section seems like a good short summary for users who won’t be scrolling all the way down the webpage. The results may be more statistically significant if I had more participants, but since it’s not, I have decided to leave it as is and keep the ‘Bridge Helps You..’ section on the webpage.</p>
    <h3>| A</h3>
    <img>without summary</img>
    <h3>| B</h3>
    <img>with summary</img>

    <p>Test 3 - Which logo (on top left) do you prefer? Filled or outlined?</p>
    <p>I had 14 participants who took the test. 14% preferred the filled logo vs the outline (86%)</p>
    <h3>| A</h3>
    <img>filled logo</img>
    <h3>| B</h3>
    <img>outlined logo</img>

    <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
    <p>Landing page alignment & shapes</p>
    <p>I had 16 participants in the test. 69% preferred the center-alignment over the 31% (left). Some of the reasons being: less crowded, better use of space, etc.</p>
    <img>top aligned</img>
    <img>center aligned</img>
    <p>I had 18 participants in the test. 56% preferred making the Recently Viewed files/folders a different size vs 44% who wanted to keep it the same as others.</p>
    <img>same folder</img>
    <img>small folder</img>

    <h2>MOCKUPS</h2>
    <p>CTA buttons</p>
    <p>I had 15 participants in the test. 53% preferred keep the CTA buttons colored vs 47%.</p>
    <p>Old | Rectangular and colored</p>
    <img>pink</img>
    <p>New | Rounded corners with shadow</p>
    <img>white</img>

    <p>Text under icons</p>
    <p>I had 17 participants in the test. 71% preferred the icons with labels vs 29% who wanted to leave it out.</p>
    <p>Old | No text under icons</p>
    <img>pink</img>
    <p>New | With text</p>
    <img>white</img>

    <p>Text color</p>
    <p>Old | Black</p>

    <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What worked?</p>
      <p>Clear icons, label<br>Easy export to other cloud system<br>Organization/Easier navigation<br>Security when sharing<br>Collaborating</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What didn't</p>
      <p>Need to explore more color logo options / + button location</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What were your doubts going into the project?</p>
      <p>How would mine stand out in the saturated cloud storages market?</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What surprised you the most?</p>
      <p>“Get Started button” This sometimes hinders users from scrolling down and reading the rest of the landing page information. Users click the Get Started button immediately instead.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What would you have done differently if given more time?</p>
      <p>I would do A&B Testing on the “Get Started’ button specifically and on more variety of users.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>What did you learn while doing this project?</p>
      <p>Testing is key!! Style guide may change once A&B Testing kicks in (my font color, icons, etc.).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <div>line</div>
      <p>How will you use that information in the future?</p>
      <p>Learn to trust the research process. Sometimes you may have a strong opinion about a design, but it won’t work ultimately. You need to learn to let it go (ex: landing page layout; Get Started CTA button).</p>
